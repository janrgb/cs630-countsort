## Setup
- Ensure you have Python v3.12.X installed. Linux distributions usually come with it by default, so use `python --version` or `python3 --version` to check your Python version on command line. If on a Windows or Mac, you will need to download it.
- If you don't have the correct version, either download it for Windows/Mac from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or for Ubuntu following [this guide](https://cloudbytes.dev/snippets/upgrade-python-to-latest-version-on-ubuntu-linux)
- Examine the `requirements.txt` file for all dependencies.
- If using Windows or Mac, use `pip install tk` to get tkinter and `pip install numpy` to get numpy (on command line).
- If using Linux, use `sudo apt install tk` to get tkinter and `sudo apt install numpy` to get numpy (on command line).
